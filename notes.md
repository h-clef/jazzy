JAZZY - notes
25-06-2020

I divide my jazz piano skills into three main categories:
	1. Memorization of tunes and standards
	2. Improvisation / 'Playing over changes'
	3. Ear training / transcription

The first and second of these, at least, are amenable to an interpretation of jazz performance as a data structure: the changes (up to and including full tunes) can be seen as static, linear data, while the act of playing over them can be viewed as a series of choices from trees of 'possible implementations'.

From this perspective, a player's skill can be seen as a measure of the size (depth) and diversity (breadth) of these trees, while their style might be encoded as the (non-deterministic) algorithms by which the trees are navigated in real time.

This description is not an attempt at a full codification of jazz theory; rather, I want to use it as a design guide to generate efficient training and exploration methods for myself and for anyone who feels they might benefit from them.
